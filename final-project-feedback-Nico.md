### ***Final Project Feedback***

**Overall**  

Fantastic job! You have come a long way. That was a lot of work you put in -- and it worked!

I don't have any advice as of now. As you can see, the basic architecture proved to work exceptionally well. The only final things you could do, as you noted, was experiment with different forms of regularization: dropout, photo augmentation (re-scaling, rotation, etc.), etc. Otherwise, you would just be experimenting with slightly different architectures. In particular, you could experiment with making your NN a bit deeper by adding another, or different, convolutional layer.

I also might recommend that you try out some different optimizers. As you did later, Adam may be nice to try out!

**Presentations**  
Also, as you started to do later in your notebook, think of ways you can pick out images that you predicted as cats or dogs and show them! This is an effective way to display where your model hits or misses (precision vs. recall).

Also, make some nice model performance graphs too!
