More importantly, I know how to poke around and find gaps in coverage plus where to go to find more data to fill those gaps.\n",

    "The output workflow would ideally look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Feed images through trained model.\n",
    "    2. Get predictions and filter out the largest one, using a threshold of n%.\n",

    "        • Move image into x category. (mkdir if needed)\n",
    "        \n",
    "As the script is running, the images in the target folder should slowly move into one of five new folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Humans\n",
    "    • Animals\n",
    "    • Cityscapes\n",
    "    • Nature scenes\n",
    "    • Uncategorized\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Success metric:\n",
    "If the project correctly categorizes a majority of the images, I will consider this a success. If only some of the images are correctly categorized, but most of the are marked as 'Uncategorized', then I would consider it a minor success that could be further iterated on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the project fails, then hopefully it's merely a matter of needing more training data."
