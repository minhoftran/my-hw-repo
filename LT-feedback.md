***Project 1: Photo Classifying***  
Awesome project, and super relevant to your work. Definitely recommend this one, especially given what you would like to get out of the course. I will forewarn that we do not cover the topic of Neural Nets much in this course, and it would be a **lot** of work on your own, and with the help of some of your co-workers. Great project if you want a serious push.


***Project 2: Simpsons***  
This one is a fairly large engineering undertaking. Running this thing through frames of an episode would be so, so cool, but it's not that simple. Also, I do not have any experience doing that, but maybe Haskie has? In addition, the task of recognizing character image is not quite the same of a character in a frame of a video. You could definitely do this one and scale it back to an order more like the first one and just try to take other photos of the characters and see if it recognizes them! That would be cool.


***Project 3: Accidents***  
Not much to say on this one. Definitely doable and a great fall-back!
